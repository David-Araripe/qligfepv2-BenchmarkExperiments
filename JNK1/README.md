Forn JNK1 we saw that ligand 18660-1 was the one "entering" the most the binding site. However, there wasn't a need for aligning the ligands, as they already overlapped quite well in space.

What we did instead was minimizing the pocket by selecting the atoms within 3 A of the protein structure using Maestro and then applying a energy minimization to the selected atoms, while having all the ligands loaded in the workspace.
